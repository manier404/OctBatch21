In my project we follow Agile scrum process.

In my team we have 5 developers and 2 tester, we follow 2 week Sprint.

Day 1 starts with Sprint planning, before we go for sprint planning, we have sprint grooming meeting.

we analyze the user stories and if we have any doubts,we get it clarify with our PO in grooming meeting then we go for sprint planning.

In sprint planning, we size and task the user stories.For sizing the user stories we use fibonacci series numbers.
soon after sizing, I create tasks like prepare test scenarios,to prepare test scripts for the user stories assigned to me.

Day 2 onwards we work in the tasks we have created.
 
 On a daily basis we have the scrum meeting, here we discuss whats the plan for today and whatwe did yesterday
 
If we have any impediments then we need to address that in the scrum meeting.

On the last day of our sprint, we have the sprint review, here we show the product demo to the customer.

Then we go for sprint retrospective, here we discuss what went well and what went not well.
