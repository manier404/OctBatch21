Levels of testing / Types of testing:
*****************


1.Unit testing / component testing.--> module wise we will test it. (Developer side)

2.Integration testing.--> all the modules r integrated and tested.

3.System Testing.-->system to system/ Funtional & non functional testing.

4.Acceptence testing.--> user accepence testing...(client / users)(chrome-Beta version)
 

INtegration testing:

1. Big Bang approach.
after completion of all the modules ,testing will be carried out

Drawbacks:

1.Ideal resurces.
2.if any bugs or mismatch with requirements we need to start again.consumes lot of time. 

2. Incremental Approach.
top to bottom approach
bottom to top approach
both (Combination)


System testing:(White box and Black box):

White box: (Developers) 

Black box testing:(Testers)

Functional testing:4000 test cases

Smoke testing -->Critical 500 cases
Sanity testing --> updates /patches  50 cases
Regression testing --> feasible (Automation testing) 3000 cases

Non Functional Testing: 450 cases

Stress testing - Load testing /volume testing
performance testing--S
system requirement /Compaitable testing
Security testing - leagal aspects 
migration testing--
